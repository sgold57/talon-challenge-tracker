Talon Challenge Tracker is a convenient and fun way to keep track of progress completing the Talons Challenge!
The Talons challenge is an annual event where skiers and snowboarders try to complete 14 of Beaver Creek's black and double-black diamond runs in one day.  Covering over 26,000 feet of vertical completing this feat is not to be underestimated.  The 14 runs, in suggested order of completion, are listed below:

1. Goshawk
2. Bald Eagle
3. Screech Owl
4. Peregrine
5. Kestrel
6. Golden Eagle: the extra ride up the Cinch Express (#8) will give your legs the rest they need!
7. Loco: This is a long run on Larkspur, great to get out of the way.
8. Ruffed Grouse
9. Shooting Star
10. Raven Ridge
11. Ptarmigan
12. Lupine
13. Bald Eagle
14. Falcon Park

Good luck, and make sure you have health insurance before attempting this challenge.  It will probably take years off your life, but isn't that a fair price to pay for bragging rights at apr√®s ski?
